<p style="text-align: left"> waveSurface really begins as a personal commitment to quality and refusal to compromise standards during my time working for flowrider.

I've always dedicated myself to being able to deliver the highest quality product to customers and to ensure they are always setup for long term success.

Over time I've absorbed a lot of feedback and experienced first hand what has worked well and what hasn't. I've always tried to learn what I needed to know in order to ensure better outcomes.

This platform is a passion project to combine some of the skills i've learned over the years in Web Development, Software Engineering, Graphic/Motion Design, CAD Modeling, Product Design, Supply Chain/Logistics, Marketing/Sales.. All coming together around an industry I have a lot of knowledge in. 

I look forward to developing the waveSurface project and continuing to innovate as the inspiration comes.
